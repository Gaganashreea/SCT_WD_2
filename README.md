# Stopwatch Application ⏱️

## Overview

This is 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤-𝟐 of my 𝐒𝐤𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐂𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐭 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩, where I built a simple and user-friendly 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐩𝐰𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡  using 𝐇𝐓𝐌𝐋, 𝐂𝐒𝐒, and 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚𝐒𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭. The stopwatch allows users to start, pause, reset, and record lap times, with a clean and responsive interface.

## Features

- 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭/𝐏𝐚𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲: Easily start or pause the stopwatch with a single button.
- 𝐋𝐚𝐩 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠: Track multiple lap times during the same session.
- 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐭: Reset the timer and laps to the initial state.
- 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧: Ensures a smooth experience on all device sizes.
- 𝐃𝐲𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐜 𝐁𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐠𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝: A visually appealing background image with fixed attachment.

## Technologies Used

- 𝐇𝐓𝐌𝐋𝟓: For structuring the layout of the stopwatch.
- 𝐂𝐒𝐒𝟑: To style the page and create a semi-transparent background for the stopwatch container.
- 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚𝐒𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭: To implement the stopwatch’s logic (start, pause, reset, lap functions) and dynamic updates.

## Functionality Breakdown

- 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭/𝐏𝐚𝐮𝐬𝐞: Clicking the "Start" button will begin the stopwatch and toggle the button text to "Pause". Pausing will stop the timer but keep the elapsed time saved for resuming.
- 𝐋𝐚𝐩: When the stopwatch is running, clicking the "Lap" button records the current time as a lap, which appears in the list below.
- 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐭: Clicking the "Reset" button will stop the timer, reset the elapsed time to zero, clear all lap records, and reset the "Start" button.
